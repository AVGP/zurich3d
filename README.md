## What's this?
This is using the [Digital Surface Model](http://www.are.zh.ch/internet/baudirektion/are/de/aktuell/mitteilungen/gis/2015/hoehendatenzh.html) gathered by the [GIS Centre of Zurich](http://www.are.zh.ch/internet/baudirektion/are/de/aktuell/mitteilungen/gis.html).

[Take a look here](http://avgp.github.io/zurich3d). Loads 70 MB of JSON, so be patient, please :)

## What's in here?
You'll get a pretty, colourful model that you can zoom into, turn around and bask in its gorgeousness.
Looks like this:
